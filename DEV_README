=== TODOs ===

If you are interested in contributing to Heroics Mode, there are a few TODOs 
sprinkled through the code. Some of these are simply decisions that need to be 
finalized, but others are places where some coding needs to be done.

### decisions

=== Amp-tags ===

Throughout the WML of Heroics Mode I have placed what I call amp-tags: an 
ampersand followed by a tag. These are in the comments and draw attention to 
the following code. Currently there are two amp-tags in use:

* `&remix` tags draw attention to code that will often need to be changed or 
  removed when Heroics Mode is used in a campaign.
* `&devfor` tags draw attention to code important to scenario and era 
  developers who wish to support Heroics Mode.

While the most accurate way to find these tags is to do a multi-file search or 
to use cat+grep, the lists below should be fairly accurate.

### &remix
events.cfg:82
events.cfg:109
events.cfg:132
events.cfg:140
goods.cfg:11
goods.cfg:99
menus.cfg:7
utils.cfg:28
utils.cfg:72
utils.cfg:90

### &devfor

=== Lua Howtos ===

Because I found getting into Lua+Wesnoth to have a very steep learning curve, I 
am writing a series of Lua Howtos to explain the process. See lua_howto.html.
